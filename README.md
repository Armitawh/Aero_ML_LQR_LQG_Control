# Aero LQR & LQG Control System

## About
This repository demonstrates **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design** for a 2-DOF aerospace system (pitch and yaw). It includes:

- Nonlinear system linearization using symbolic MATLAB calculations.
- LQR controller design.
- LQR with integral action for improved reference tracking.
- LQG observer design for state estimation.
- Saving controller and observer gains for deployment.
